A zombie plague has broken out in the world of Unciv... and if you like, you can be the zombies! Devour and conquer the world with your tireless flesh-eating army!

There's a catch, though: the undead cannot build. They can only infect (and they're not so great at trading). Your only way to acquire new cities is to conquer them. Fortunately, you're pretty good at that.
